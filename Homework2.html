    <!-- 1. Define structural vs semantic meaning in regard to HTML elements.
        - Structural elements have an effect on the structure of a page but doesn't necessarily convey any meaning.
        - Semantic elements are intended to convey meaning with that element type, even if it is indistinguishable from other elemnts visually.
          for example bold vs. strong. -->
    
    <!-- 2. Why is it important to use correct html elements when designing web pages?
         - Correct HTML elements enhance accessibility, maintainability, and SEO (search engine optimization). -->
    
      <!-- 3. What are forms in html? What is their purpose? When would you use one?
         - Forms are an element that is used to to collect user input, and sends it to a server for processing.
         - Their purpose is to gather information, such as user details.
         - Forms are used when interaction and input from the user are required. -->

    <!-- 4. Define and contrast inline vs block elements.
         - Block elements start on a new line and take up the full width available from left to right.
         - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary -->
